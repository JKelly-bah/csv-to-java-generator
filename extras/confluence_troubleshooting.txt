h2. Issue #1: IntelliJ Git Bash Terminal Not Recognizing Maven Commands

h3. Problem Description

When using the integrated Git Bash terminal within IntelliJ IDEA, Maven (mvn) commands were not recognized despite Maven being properly installed and added to the system PATH. 

*Symptoms:*
* Maven commands work correctly in standalone Git Bash terminal (launched from Start menu)
* IntelliJ GUI Maven integration functions properly (builds successfully)
* Built applications fail to run when using IntelliJ's integrated Git Bash terminal
* Error occurs specifically with the integrated terminal, not with external Git Bash

h3. Environment

* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
* Terminal: Git Bash (integrated)
* Build Tool: Maven
* OS: Windows (inferred from Start menu reference)

h3. Root Cause

The issue appears to be related to IntelliJ's cached project configuration and environment settings stored in the `.idea` folder. This folder contains IDE-specific project metadata that can become corrupted or outdated, causing environment variable and PATH issues within the integrated terminal.

h3. Solution

{code}
1. Close IntelliJ IDEA completely
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Delete the .idea folder (this contains IntelliJ-specific project settings)
4. Restart IntelliJ IDEA
5. Reopen your project
{code}

h3. Steps to Implement

# *Close IntelliJ IDEA*
   - Ensure all instances of IntelliJ are completely closed
# *Locate Project Directory*
   - Navigate to your project's root directory in File Explorer
# *Delete .idea Folder*
   - Locate the `.idea` folder in your project root
   - Delete the entire `.idea` folder
   - {color:red}*Warning:* This will reset project-specific IDE settings{color}
# *Restart IntelliJ*
   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA
   - Open your project (IntelliJ will recreate the `.idea` folder with fresh settings)
# *Verify Fix*
   - Open the integrated Git Bash terminal
   - Test Maven commands (e.g., `mvn --version`, `mvn clean compile`)

h3. Expected Outcome

After completing these steps:
* The integrated Git Bash terminal in IntelliJ should recognize Maven commands
* Maven builds and application execution should work correctly from within IntelliJ
* The fix applies to all projects, not just the current one

h3. Additional Notes

* This solution resets IntelliJ project-specific configurations, so you may need to reconfigure some IDE settings
* The `.idea` folder is automatically regenerated by IntelliJ, so no permanent data loss occurs
* This fix addresses environment variable recognition issues in IntelliJ's integrated terminals

h3. References

* Solution found on Stack Overflow
* Verified to work across multiple projects
